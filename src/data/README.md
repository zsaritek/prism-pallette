# Seed data

This folder contains JSON seed data that ships with the app.

- `components.json`: initial component catalog (Button, Badge, Card) and variant lists
- `tokens.json`: default design tokens (primary/secondary, radius, spacing)

Runtime edits are stored locally (see `README.md` for the storage keys).
